# Interface Segregation Principle 
Defined by Robert C. Martin, while consulting Xerox to build software for new printer systems
- "Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they don't use"
    - a client should not implement an interface if it does not use a method in that interface
    - happens, when one interface contains more than one functionality, and the client only needs one functionality and not the other one
