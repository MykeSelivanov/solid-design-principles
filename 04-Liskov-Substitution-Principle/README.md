# Liskov Substitution Principle

#### Principle defines that objects of a superclass can be replacable with objects of its subclasses without breaking the application
- requires the objects of subclasses to behave in the same way as objects of superclasses
- methods which use a superclass type must be able to work with the subclass without any issues
